## Meeting Summary

As science moves toward more modular ways of sharing and publishing research, peer review must evolve alongside it. Research is increasingly produced as data, methods, code, figures, and interpretations that emerge and change over time, yet trust, evaluation, and credit remain bundled around the paper and a single moment of judgment. This gap limits reuse, obscures where contributions actually happen, and concentrates authority rather than distributing it across research components. CSF and PREreview have partnered to help close this gap, building shared approaches to reviewing components in ways that travel with research itself. Open access removed barriers to reading research; this work explores how trust and evaluation can move alongside research as it is created, reused, and combined.

### Who was in the room

**Roles** were diverse, bringing perspectives across disciplines, career stages, and institutional contexts. From publishers & journal teams, librarians, researchers & ECRs, Infrastructure & product/tool builders, open science & community members.

1. Participants **joined from** 🇨🇦 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇪🇺 🇲🇽 🇨🇱 🇳🇬 🇮🇳 🥐 and beyond
2. **Relationship to modular research & publishing** ranged from formal and informal ways like reuse, connection to the paper, links between parts 📄 ➝ 🧱 📊 📦 💻 🧪 🔍 🧠 ♻️ 🔗
3. **What people wanted to refine, improve or rethink in peer review** was grounded in purpose, trust/fairness and cycles/time 🎯 🧩 ➝ 🧠 ⚖️ 🔎 🔄 ⏳
4. **Types of work** that were represented ranged from publishing, research, infrastructure, funding, and community building 📚 🧑‍🏫 🧪 👩‍🔬 👨‍🔬 🛠️ 🧑‍💻 🏛️ 💡 🌱 🤝

### How we are working together

- No AI or Notetaking bots
- Our [code of conduct](https://prereview.org/code-of-conduct)
  - Contact CSF or PREreview hosts with any issues or
  - Email [conduct@continuousfoundation.org](mailto:conduct@continuousfoundation.org) or
  - Fill out [our anonymous form](https://airtable.com/appcuwRZxXLPljgmY/shrdlP8gV7xI2GPfv)
- We have four principles of working together:
  - **Messy by design:** Early ideas and unfinished thinking are welcome.
  - **Human-first:** Care, curiosity, and lived experience come first.
  - **Not a race to first place:** We value collective progress over individual authority.
  - **Many ways to contribute:** Participation can flex over time and capacity.
- We are using:
  - **Lazy consensus:** We move forward unless there is a clear reason not to.
    **Zone of tolerance:** Full agreement is not required to make progress.

- A clear through-line across the group was a desire for this work to leave the room and be built on together.

### Case Study

:::{card} 🏗️ Building Codes—From One Big Stamp to Modular Approval Pathways
:link: https://articles.continuousfoundation.org/articles/building-code-review

A case study from outside academia: building reviews and inspections conducted by specialists at different stages, rather than a single approval at the end.

### Ideation of Review Components

:::{card} 🧠 Session 1 Brainstorm — A 15-Minute Experiment
:link: session-1-brainstorm.md

The group’s first hands-on task: 15 minutes generating an exhaustive list of research components that could be reviewed on their own terms. Read the brainstorm summary.
