title: Modular Peer Review Working Group
abstract: |
  The **Modular Peer Review Working Group** is a collaboration between Continuous Science Foundation (CSF) and PREreview. The group exists because science is already shifting toward a future where the paper is no longer the nucleus of sharing research. Trust, evaluation, and feedback can no longer be confined to a single object or a single moment in time. Modular peer review explores how review, verification, and credit can attach to research components, data, methods, code, figures, models, and interpretations, as they are created, reused, and combined. Today the system obscures contributions, discourages reuse, and concentrates authority.

:::{important} Active Working Group
We are continuously documenting the progress of this working group, which kicked off on January 22, 2026. There will be ongoing updates to this space, which can be edited or updated on GitHub, through participation in the working group sessions, or by subscribing to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/continuousfoundation.org/g/modular-peer-review).

## Participants

Over sixty participants have joined the working group across continents and time zones, publishers, librarians, researchers, early-career scholars, infrastructure builders, funders, and open science community organizers. They come from different disciplines, different institutional incentives, and very different lived experiences.

- Participants are joining from 🇨🇦 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇪🇺 🇲🇽 🇨🇱 🇳🇬 🇮🇳 🥐 and beyond
- Relationship to modular research & publishing ranged from formal and informal ways like reuse, connection to the paper, links between parts 📄 ➝ 🧱 📊 📦 💻 🧪 🔍 🧠 ♻️ 🔗
- People want to refine, improve or rethink in peer review was grounded in purpose, trust/fairness and cycles/time 🎯 🧩 ➝ 🧠 ⚖️ 🔎 🔄 ⏳
- Types of work that were represented ranged from publishing, research, infrastructure, funding, and community building 📚 🧑‍🏫 🧪 👩‍🔬 👨‍🔬 🛠️ 🧑‍💻 🏛️ 💡 🌱 🤝

What this group shares is not a single solution, or even agreement on the problem. What they shared was a **willingness to move**. Instead of waiting for permission, they are showing up ready to experiment, explore, and ideate.

## How We Are Working

The working group is a space for co-creation. Together, we are exploring how peer review can evolve in a modular publishing ecosystem—where datasets, code, methods, figures, and other components are shared independently and iteratively. All outcomes from the working group will documented and licensed CC-BY-4.0. We are following PREreview's [code of conduct](https://prereview.org/code-of-conduct) following four grounding principles for how we work:

- **Messy by design:** Early ideas and unfinished thinking are welcome.
- **Human-first:** Care, curiosity, and lived experience come before polish or performance.
  **Not a race to first place:** Collective progress matters more than individual authority.
- **Many ways to contribute:** Participation can flex over time and capacity.

To help the group move without requiring unanimity, sessions operate using **lazy consensus**, moving forward unless there is a clear reason not to, and a [**zone of tolerance**](https://circleforward.us/consent-arises-within-a-range-of-tolerance), where full agreement is not required for progress. Consent is understood as something that arises within a range, rather than at a single point of perfect alignment.

## Working Group Goals

- Pinpoint key challenges in providing constructive, modular feedback to research objects including but not limited to research proposals, research posters, preprints, datasets, reproducible notebooks, code, methods, and figures
- Map existing approaches and examples that this group can surface, build from and adapt.
- Explore opportunities that reflect the realities of modular science.

## Progress

The working group kicked off in January 2026, and will continue with monthly working sessions to wrap up in Spring 2026. You can follow along with our progress here.

### Inspiration

:::{card} 🏗️ Building Codes—From One Big Stamp to Modular Approval Pathways
:link: https://articles.continuousfoundation.org/articles/building-code-review

A case study from outside academia: building reviews and inspections conducted by specialists at different stages, rather than a single approval at the end. The case-study is designed to spark inspiration on how an industry changed it's practices from a single review at the end, to modular and composable reviews along the way — improving safety and rigour in construction

### Sessions

Summary, agenda, and outcomes from the January 22, 2026 kickoff. We met eachother, set some guidelines for how we will work together. See the slides and notes here.

The group’s first hands-on task: 15 minutes generating an exhaustive list of research components that could be reviewed on their own terms. Read the brainstorm notes.

**Our next meeting is February 17, 2026.**

This space is an evolving document. We will continue to update it as the working group progresses, and we invite others to contribute—whether by joining sessions, suggesting [edits on GitHub](https://github.com/continuous-foundation/modular-peer-review), or sharing feedback via the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/continuousfoundation.org/g/modular-peer-review).

All working group participants are part of this effort and its outputs. Some participants have chosen to remain or be listed anonymously; we thank everyone who has shown up, experimented, and helped shape this work.
