title: A 15-Minute Experiment

The group’s first chance to roll up their sleeves came to join small groups and generate an exhaustive list of research components that could be reviewed, evaluated, or given feedback on as an independent component.

Participants were explicitly asked to work quickly. The exercise was messy by design, embracing incompleteness to surface ideas quickly, with the understanding that the next six months would allow the group to return, iterate, and reshape what emerged.

There was no debate. No prioritization. No pressure to be right. No wrong answers.

To spark thinking, the group drew inspiration from a case study outside academia: [building reviews and inspections](https://articles.continuousfoundation.org/articles/building-code-review) conducted by specialists at different stages, rather than a single approval at the end. That shift offered a useful parallel for imagining how peer review might operate across review purposes and research components over time, instead of arriving only once everything is bundled together.

**In 15 minutes, the paper shrank from destination to a singular waypoint.**

Research questions and study design. Ethics approvals and position statements. Data, materials, and metadata. Code, models, and computational notebooks. Analysis, interpretation, figures, manuscripts. Communication artifacts. Reviews themselves.

The list above shows an imperfect but initial categorization of that list, created only to make its breadth visible. These categories are intentionally loose, not a taxonomy or a roadmap, but a snapshot of collective thinking, captured before it hardens.

### Why Share This Now

This list is not _done_. It is meant to _exist_ and be _improved_. It reflects what a diverse group surfaced together and think beyond inherited containers. Some components overlap. Some feel obvious. Others feel uncomfortable or under-explored. That unevenness is a signal that there is real work to do.

By sharing this early, the group is inviting others into the process.

## Summary of Ideation Reflection

- Strong alignment on the need for modular review:
  - The group broadly agreed that reviewing entire papers obscures important contributions, and that modular review better reflects how research is actually produced and used.
- Clear appetite for specialization in review:
  - Many noted that different components require different expertise, for example, statisticians, data editors, clinicians, software reviewers, rhetoricians, and that modular review could allow people to contribute where they are strongest.
- Disciplinary diversity matters
  - Multiple reflections emphasized that what is “niche” in one field may be essential in another, and that modular systems must accommodate field-specific norms rather than impose a single model.
- The purpose of the review needs clarification.
  - Some participants flagged discomfort with moving forward without clearly defining what “review” is for, whether feedback, validation, decision-making, or post-publication evaluation, highlighting this as an important area for future work.
- Existing practices can be scaled:
  - Several noted that many forms of modular or informal review already happen today, including sleuthing, micro-review, and social media critique, but are undervalued or invisible in formal systems.
- Opportunities beyond traditional academics:
  - Some highlighted the potential for modular review to engage non-scholars, practitioners, and contributors who are often excluded from conventional peer review.
- Time and process trade-offs were visible:
  - Some groups found the spreadsheet exercise productive for capture but limiting for discussion, surfacing a tension between documentation and dialogue that the group may want to design around going forward.
- Overall tone was energized and collaborative:
  - Reflections consistently described excitement, “low-hanging fruit,” and a sense that this work is both timely and achievable, paired with appreciation for the open, exploratory approach to tackling it.
