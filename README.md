# Modular Peer Review Working Group

A collaboration between [Continuous Science Foundation](https://continuousfoundation.org) and [PREreview](https://prereview.org) exploring how peer review can evolve in a modular publishing ecosystem.

## Goals

- **Pinpoint** key challenges in providing constructive, modular feedback to research objects (proposals, preprints, datasets, code, methods, figures, and more).
- **Map** existing approaches and examples the group can surface, build from, and adapt.
- **Explore** opportunities that reflect the realities of modular science.

## Code of conduct
